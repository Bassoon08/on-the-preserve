On the Preserve: Text Adventure Game through “Bloodchild”
===============

This text adventure game is written in python and is based on Octavia Butler’s short story “Bloodchild.” To fully appreciate the game, I suggest you first read the story, which can be found here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/bloodchi.htm

## How to play
To play the game, you need to start python with the game engine using the text file as an argument:

```
python game.py preserve.txt
```

## Video
The gameplay video can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo7dEMYX7RU
